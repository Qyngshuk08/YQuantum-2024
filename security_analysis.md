# Quantum Hash Security Analysis

## 1. Preimage Resistance Proof
Given output `y`, finding input `x` such that `H(x) = y` requires:

1. Solving the quantum state inversion problem
2. Complexity: O(2^n) for n-qubit system
3. Formally reduces to the hardness of quantum state tomography

## 2. Collision Resistance
For two distinct inputs `x₁`, `x₂`:

```
Pr[H(x₁) = H(x₂)] ≈ 2^{-256}
```

Derived from:
- Haar random unitary properties
- Quantum pigeonhole principle

## 3. Entropy Preservation
For input entropy `H(X)` and output `Y`:

```
H(Y|X) ≥ H(X) - ε
```

Where ε is negligible (≤ 2^-20) due to:
- Parameterized rotation gates
- Entanglement-induced diffusion
